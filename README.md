# A simple React TypeScript starter app using the Vite bundler

## System requirements

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >=12.2.0
- It is also recommended **(but not required)** that you have the React dev tools browser extension installed and enabled

## Scripts

- `yarn install`

Install all local dependencies

- `yarn dev`

Start dev server

- `yarn build`

Build for production

- `yarn preview`

Locally preview production build

- `yarn lint`

Run linter across the code base

## Linting and code standards

A very simple setup using [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) has been employed in this starter project. It was kept basic on purpose, to allow for easy configuration based on user preferences. It will still catch all the **recommended** lint errors for standard React TypeScript apps.
